# Intro
We are not allowed to run any command with characters from the alphabet. However, we are allowed to use numbers and symbols.

# Attempts

```bash
SansAlpha$ /???
bash: /bin: Is a directory


SansAlpha$ ./??????/????.???
bash: ./blargh/flag.txt: Permission denied


SansAlpha$ /???/??????                  <--- /bin/base64

SansAlpha$ /???/????64 ./??????/????.???
/bin/base64: extra operand '/bin/x86_64'
Try '/bin/base64 --help' for more information. (We are also matching /bin/x86_64 unintentionally. We will ommit it in the next attempt)

SansAlpha$ /???/???[!_]64 ./??????/????.???  <-- (4th char won't contain _ )
cmV0dXJuIDAgcGljb0NURns3aDE1X211MTcxdjNyNTNfMTVfbTRkbjM1NV9iMGQ1ZTg1NX0=



```

# Final
We received the base64 encoded flag. Let's decode it now

```bash
$ calypse@fsociety [~]: echo "cmV0dXJuIDAgcGljb0NURns3aDE1X211MTcxdjNyNTNfMTVfbTRkbjM1NV9iMGQ1ZTg1NX0=" | base64 -d
return 0 picoCTF{7h15_mu171v3r53_15_m4dn355_b0d5e855}
```
