My name is Pranjal Basak. I go by the handle **APOC4LYPSE**. I have created this site to document my cyber security journey since 2019. As I am working for my degree and working on several research papers and personal projects, it is not possible to document every bits and bytes of the knowledge I gained through my entire journey, however, I will try my level best to publish my knowledge base and personal projects as byte-sized blog posts and help people who are just starting out.


# Backstory
My love for computers started way back in sixth grade, when I realized that you could write a few lines of code and make a machine do whatever you wanted. That blew my mind. I fell in love with programming and spent countless hours writing C code, breaking things (intentionally), and figuring out how it all worked under the hood.

In 2019, I stumbled upon CTFs, and it felt like unlocking a whole new level of fun. Since then, I’ve been hooked on hacking—ethically, of course.

Fast forward to now: I’m working on my BSc in Computer Science at BRAC University. Along the way, I’ve dabbled in a ton of projects and picked up C, C++, Python, Kotlin, and JavaScript. But my heart? It’s in low-level stuff. Reverse engineering, binary exploitation, assembly language—I thrive on getting deep into the guts of a system and making it do things it wasn’t meant to.

Here’s a bit of what I’m good at:

- Breaking into web apps and networks
- Writing sneaky malware payloads (for testing purposes, promise!)
- Exploiting systems and climbing my way up to root or admin privileges

I’m more about hands-on learning than collecting certs, but I’ve recently added the Google Cybersecurity Certificate to my belt.

Always up for a chat or collab! I’d love to connect with folks who are just as passionate about cybersecurity and spreading knowledge as I am. Let’s make the internet a safer place—one hack at a time.
